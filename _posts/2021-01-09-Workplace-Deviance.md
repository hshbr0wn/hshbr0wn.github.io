A lot has become available at our fingertips. Technology such as cell phones with internet applications make it simple for a person to spend more time on those phones than on their work. Some organizations may allow cell phone use in downtime but certain job functions are supposed to take the full attention of the worker at all times. Cell phones pose a threat to those kind of job functions. In addition to cell phones, there are also more technological avenues for workers to steal sensitive data from within an organization. Cybersecurity professionals must be aware of insider threats and ensure privilege is not granted where it shouldnâ€™t and systems are monitor for nefarious internal activity as well as external threats. Ultimately, there is a great reward to many of these relatively new technologies and every organization deserves the opportunity to reap the benefits. Accepting the risk of workplace deviance is part of it all but ensuring proper policies are in place and cybersecurity personnel are hired will assist in reducing deviance.
